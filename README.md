## Overview
This proof of concept (POC) shows you how to configure a CircleCI pipeline for a sample blog application that combines the power of Spring Boot and Kotlin. Within this pipeline: test, build, and deploy a Docker image to a private repository on Amazon‚Äôs Elastic Container Registry. Additionally, this POC demonstrates pulling down this image and deploying it to EKS, where the blog application can be accessed on port 8080.

## About CircleCI
CircleCI is a continuous integration and delivery platform that aids software teams by automating the build, test, and deploy process.

## What are Orbs? 
CircleCI orbs are open-source, shareable packages of parameterizable reusable configuration elements, including jobs, commands, and executors. Use orbs to reduce configuration complexity and help you integrate with your software and services stack quickly and easily across many projects.

## How CircleCI Uses Environment Variables


## Pipeline Rundown ( the pipeline ran us down into the ground)

*What Orbs Were Used and Why?*

* gradle: circleci/gradle@2.2.0
Gradle is utilized for testing the sample blog application.
* aws-cli: circleci/aws-cli@2.0.2
Allows a user to interface / authenticate with aws (ECR/EKS).
* aws-ecr: circleci/aws-ecr@7.0.0
For pushing and pulling images from an ECR repository.
* helm: circleci/helm@1.2.0
Managing the blog application in Kubernetes
* aws-eks: circleci/aws-eks@0.2.3=:
Installing the aws-iam-authenticator to authenticate with EKS. Installing the blog helm chart to the cluster.

*Executors*

An executor type defines the underlying technology or environment in which to run a job. CircleCI enables you to run jobs in one of four environments:
Within Docker images (type: docker üê≥) 
Within a Linux virtual machine (VM) image(type: machine)
Within a macOS image (type: macos)
Within a Windows VM image (type: windows)
	
*Jobs/Commands*

Jobs are collections of steps. All of the steps in the job are executed in a single unit, either within a fresh container or VM.
* Workspaces persist data between jobs in a single workflow
* Caching persists data between the same job in different workflows runs
* Artifacts persist data after a workflow has finished

A command definition defines a sequence of steps as a map to be executed in a job, enabling you to reuse a single command definition across multiple jobs.

*Workflow*

Workflows define a list of jobs and their run order. It is possible to run jobs concurrently, sequentially, on a schedule, or with a manual gate using an approval job.

## Caching with CircleCI

## Parallelism

The more tests your project has, the longer it will take for them to complete on a single machine. To reduce this time, you can run tests in parallel by spreading them across multiple separate executors. This requires specifying a parallelism level to define how many separate executors get spun up for the test job. Then, you can use either the CircleCI CLI to split test files, or use environment variables to configure each parallel machine individually.
